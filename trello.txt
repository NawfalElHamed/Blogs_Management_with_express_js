Certainly! I'll help you create user stories in your Trello board. Here's how you can implement them:

Trello Board Structure:

Backlog (List):
 User Story 1: As a new user, I want to register with a unique username, email, and password so that I can create an account.
 User Story 2: As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials (username and password) and see an error message for failed login attempts.
 User Story 3: As a registered user, I want to see a dashboard displaying my name, profile image, and a form to add a new blog post.
 User Story 4: As a registered user, I want to see a grid of all blog posts with titles, descriptions, authors, and associated images.
 User Story 5: As a registered user, I want to be able to edit or delete my own blog posts.
 User Story 6: As a registered user, I want to be able to update the title, description, author, and image of my blog posts.
 User Story 7: As a user, I want to see a custom 404 error page if I try to access a non-existent page or route.
